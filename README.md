# New-Tabs-at-End-3000

I forked this repository in order to add a 3 second delay when the extension is started. This is in order to prevent tab groups from getting destroyed in Brave Browser.

## How to install

Unfortunately I do not have a chrome developer account, so you'll need to enable developer mode and load the extension unpacked. Basically downlod the repository as a zip, extract the folder, then point chrome to the extracted root folder.

## Previous notes

The New Tabs at End (v2.0.3.3) extension by itworks was removed from the Chrome Store for violating the Chrome Web Store policy. 

- Version 3.0.0.2: Add a three second delay when the extension is started in order to maintain tab groups. Thanks to [@jtay9562](https://github.com/jtay9562)

- Version 3.0.0.1: Updates the extension to work with Manifest version 3 and replaces deprecated API calls with their respective replacements.
