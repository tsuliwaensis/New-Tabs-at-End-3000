# New-Tabs-at-End-3000

The New Tabs at End (v2.0.3.3) extension by itworks was removed from the Chrome Store for violating the Chrome Web Store policy. 

- Version 3.0.0.4: Revert changes from version 3.0.0.2. It was breaking the extension for many people.
  
- Version 3.0.0.3: Add a three second delay when the extension is started in order to maintain tab groups. Thanks to [@jtay9562](https://github.com/jtay9562)

- Version 3.0.0.2: Updates the extension to work with Manifest version 3 and replaces deprecated API calls with their respective replacements.

- Version 3.0.0.1: Simplified code. Hopefully, it will no longer jump to the first tab randomly

- Version 3.0.0.0: Initial release
